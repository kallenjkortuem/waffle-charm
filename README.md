## Install dependencies

Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `RIOT_GAMES_API_KEY=RGAPI-123456789 npm run nx serve api` to start the API dev server exposed on http://localhost:3333/.

> You will need to provide your own `RIOT_GAMES_API_KEY` found here: https://developer.riotgames.com/#

In a seperate console, run `npm run nx serve crow-storm` to start the frontend dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

The app or api will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run nx build crowstorm` to build the project.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run nx test crow-storm` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `npm run nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run nx e2e crow-storm-e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `npm run nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Formatting code

Run `npm run nx format:write` to format the code.

## Understand the workspace

Run `npm run nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

# Code scaffolding

## Generate an application

Run `npm run nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `npm run nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a new library.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@waffle-charm/mylib`.

## Generate a component
